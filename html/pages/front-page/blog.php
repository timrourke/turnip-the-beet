          <p>Hey everyone, welcome to the kickoff of what is sure to be a great season!</p>
          <p>As I write this, the weather outside the window shifts between rainy clouds and sunshine – picture-perfect imagery of the energy pervading this time of year. June is always a little ridiculous for us at the farm – a month that combines the apex of spring workload with the onset of summer tasks. As a turning point, June is also a crucial moment of assessment, evaluation, criticism and review. How we doin? Sustainable agriculture on any scale is an epic undertaking, and each season brings different combinations of successes and failures. But this season has got to be one for the books!</p>
